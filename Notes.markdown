* pg 31: There are two main reasons that we may wish to estimate $f$: prediction and inference.
* pg 67: Private methods are defined within a constructor or another method, but not available externally through any instance.
* pg 68: Privileged methods are defined within the constructor using the `this` keyword, and can access private methods while being publicly accessible.
* pg 70: When you declare function `foo() { ... }`, you can call the function before its definition. If you use var `foo = function() { ... }`, you can't.
* pg 74: When a method of an object is used as an event handler, you can bind `this` to the object again using `call` or `apply`.
